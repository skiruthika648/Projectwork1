## REAL-TIME SCLEROSIS DETECTION IN MRI SCANS: A CNN-BASED DEEP LEARNING MODEL INTEGRATING INTO A DJANGO WEB APPLICATION.
It presents CNN architectures for detecting sclerosis in MRI scans, focusing on TensorFlow implementation. By incorporating attention mechanisms and leveraging transfer learning, the models enhance accuracy and efficiency. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of these architectures for automated sclerosis detection in clinical settings.

## About
It investigates CNN architectures tailored for sclerosis detection in MRI scans, with a focus on efficient implementation in TensorFlow for clinical applicability. By harnessing the spatial richness of MRI data, the proposed architectures use convolutional layers for feature extraction, pooling layers for spatial reduction, and fully connected layers for classification. To improve model performance, attention mechanisms are incorporated, enabling the network to focus on regions most relevant to sclerosis. Additionally, transfer learning from pre-trained models is employed to expedite training and enhance generalization, addressing the challenge of limited labeled medical data.

Extensive experimentation is conducted on benchmark MRI datasets, where the proposed models are evaluated for accuracy, efficiency, and robustness in identifying sclerosis. Results demonstrate that these architectures provide a scalable and effective solution for automated sclerosis detection, with potential for integration into clinical workflows. This work advances the development of AI-driven diagnostic tools, promoting early intervention and better patient outcomes in neurological care.
